To compile, type
make
(or make par to cause proving mode -m5 to be multithreaded)

To repeat S1 timing run on instance 123 of Set 1, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 testproblems/weightmode5/439/myformat/123 
The corresponding output file is at output/weightmode5/439.strat1/123
Summary files are at testproblems/weightmode5/439/summary*
To generate and test a similar random example, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 -n439

To repeat S1 timing run on instance 123 of Set 2, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 testproblems/weightmode5/502/myformat/123 
The corresponding output file is at output/weightmode5/502.strat1/123
Summary files are at testproblems/weightmode5/502/summary*
To generate and test a similar random example, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 -n502

To repeat S1 timing run on instance 123 of Set 3, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 testproblems/weightmode7/439/myformat/123
The corresponding output file is at output/weightmode7/439.strat1/123
Summary files are at testproblems/weightmode7/439/summary*
To generate and test a similar random example, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 -w7 -n439

To get a list of available options, type
./qubo -?

The format of the instance-description file (such as testproblems/weightmode5/502/myformat/123) 
starts with a line giving the size of the Chimera graph. (Two numbers are given to specify an m x n
rectangle, but currently only a square, m=n, is accepted.)
The subsequent lines are of the form
<Chimera vertex> <Chimera vertex> weight
where <Chimera vertex> is specified by four numbers using the format described in the
comments at the start of qubo.c.
