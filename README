To compile, type
make
(or make par to cause proving mode -m5 to be multithreaded)

To repeat S1 timing run on instance 123 of Set 1, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 testproblems/weightmode5/439/myformat/123 
The corresponding output file is at output/weightmode5/439.strat1/123
Summary files are at testproblems/weightmode5/439/summary*
To generate and test a similar random example, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 -n439

To repeat S1 timing run on instance 123 of Set 2, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 testproblems/weightmode5/502/myformat/123 
The corresponding output file is at output/weightmode5/502.strat1/123
Summary files are at testproblems/weightmode5/502/summary*
To generate and test a similar random example, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 -n502

To repeat S1 timing run on instance 123 of Set 3, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 -x-1 testproblems/noextfield-Ising/439/myformat/123
to do it in Ising Model mode, where the state variables can be in {-1,1}, OR
./qubo -m1 -S1 testproblems/noextfield/439/myformat/123
to do it in QUBO mode, where the state variables can be in {0,1}.
Note that the two modes are equivalent, but the minimum values will be different.
For historical reasons, this run was originally conducted in Ising Model mode, and
the output files at output/weightmode3/439.-1+1.strat1/ have Ising Model values.
Ising model summary files are at testproblems/noextfield-Ising/439/summary*
and QUBO summary files are at testproblems/noextfield/439/summary*
To generate and test a similar random example, type
./qubo -m1 -S1 -w3 -x-1 -n439

To get a list of available options, type
./qubo -?

The format of the instance-description file (such as testproblems/weightmode5/502/myformat/123) 
starts with a line giving the size of the Chimera graph. (Two numbers are given to specify an m x n
rectangle, but currently only a square, m=n, is accepted.)
The subsequent lines are of the form
<Chimera vertex> <Chimera vertex> weight
where <Chimera vertex> is specified by four numbers using the format described in the
comments at the start of qubo.c.
